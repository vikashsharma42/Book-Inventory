# Book-Inventory

Project Description:
The Book Inventory Management System is a web-based application developed using the Spring Boot framework,
designed to manage the inventory of books in a bookstore or library. This system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book records,
track book availability, manage stock, and generate reports. Leveraging Spring Boot enables rapid development and deployment of the application with minimal configuration.

Key Features:

User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the system. Different user roles such as admin, librarian, and regular user can be defined with corresponding permissions.

Book CRUD Operations: Provide functionality to add new books to the inventory, view existing book details, update book information, and delete books when necessary.

Book Search and Filtering: Implement search and filtering options to allow users to find books based on criteria such as title, author, genre, ISBN, or publication year.

Inventory Management: Track the availability and stock levels of each book in the inventory. Users should be able to view real-time stock information and receive alerts for low stock levels.

Order Management: Enable users to place orders for books that are out of stock or need to be replenished. The system should handle order processing, inventory updates, and order tracking.

Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports and analytics on various aspects of the inventory such as sales trends, popular books, stock levels, and revenue generation. Visualize data using charts and graphs for better insights.

Technologies Used:

Spring Boot: For rapid application development and dependency management.
Spring Data JPA: For data access and persistence.
Thymeleaf or Angular/React/Vue.js: For frontend development (depending on preference).
MySQL For storing book and inventory data.
Project Implementation:

Database Design: Design the database schema to store book details, inventory information, user data, and order history efficiently.

Spring Boot Configuration: Set up Spring Boot project structure, configure dependencies, and establish database connections.

User Interface Development: Develop user-friendly web pages or frontend components using Thymeleaf or a modern JavaScript framework (HTML, CSS, js) for interacting with the system.

Backend Development: Implement business logic and functionalities such as CRUD operations, search algorithms, order management, and reporting using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA.
